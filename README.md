<h1> Project Overview</h1>

CrashLens is a mobile-based intelligent accident assessment system that uses
Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to analyze vehicle damage caused by
accidents.

The system aims to support drivers and insurance companies by providing faster,
more consistent, and automated damage severity classification and repair cost
estimation.

CrashLens contributes to improving accident response efficiency and aligns with
Saudi Vision 2030 goals for smart digital transformation.

## Project Goals

CrashLens is designed to:

- Classify vehicle damage severity (Minor, Moderate, Severe)
- Provide an approximate repair cost estimation
- Generate structured accident assessment reports
- Support administrators in reviewing accident cases and resolving disputes
- Reduce subjectivity and delays in traditional manual inspection processes

## Technologies Used

The project will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Flutter** – Mobile application development  
- **Firebase** – Authentication and cloud storage  
- **Python** – Backend and machine learning development  
- **CNN Models** – Vehicle damage severity prediction  
- **FastAPI / Flask** – AI inference service integration

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `docs/` → Submitted sprint reports, proposal, and documentation  
- `mobile_app/` → Flutter-based mobile frontend  
- `backend_api/` → Backend services and API endpoints  
- `ml_model/` → Machine learning training and inference components  
- `assets/` → Diagrams, images, and supporting material

## Launch Instructions

CrashLens is currently in **Sprint 0**, which focuses on project preparation,
system design, backlog creation, and repository setup.

Development and implementation will begin in **Sprint 1**, therefore the system
is not fully executable at this stage.

Once implementation starts, the project will be launched through standard tools
for Flutter and Python-based AI services. Detailed execution and deployment
instructions will be provided in upcoming sprints as the system components are
developed.

## Sprint Information

- **Sprint 0:** Setup, architecture, backlog, requirements gathering  
- **Sprint 1+:** Core implementation of mobile app and AI assessment pipeline
